Week 3 project is to create a simple application using TDD. I chose to create a
bank app. The basis of TDD is that we create failing tests before writing
production code. My Bank app has 2 attributes customer name and balance. It has
functionality to retrieve balance, add and withdraw funds in different
permutations and combinations. I have used a total of 9 test cases.

The test cases are described in detail in  [Trello](https://trello.com/b/GPdrkFyV/test-cases-for-bank-app)

Please click on the link to go to the git repo where my bank app resides.
